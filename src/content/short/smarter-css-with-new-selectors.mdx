## Write smarter CSS with :is() and :where().

Writing CSS selectors can be tedious, especially when repeating long lists of elements.

Thankfully, :is() and :where() make things much cleaner.

Both of them let you group selectors, reducing redundancy and improving readability.

There is one key difference between the 2: specificity.

- :is() inherits the highest specificity from the elements inside it. If one of its child selectors has high specificity, the whole rule does too.
- :where() always has zero specificity. It wonâ€™t override other styles unless thereâ€™s no conflicting rule.

The best part ?
They are widely supported in all modern browsers.
With over 95% support!

These selectors clean up your CSS, make maintenance easier, and help avoid specificity battles.
