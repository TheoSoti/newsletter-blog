## Responsive design isn’t just about screen size anymore.

Container queries give components the power to adapt on their own.
Responsive design isn’t just about screen size anymore.

Container queries give components the power to adapt on their own.
That’s where CSS container queries come in.
They let you apply styles based on the size of the parent, not the window.

What makes them special:

- Components become truly reusable and context-aware.
- You can build layouts that behave consistently in any environment.
- No more overrides based on where a component happens to land.

How it works:

- Set a container with `container-type: inline-size;`.
- Inside that container, use `@container` rules to style elements based on width.

Browser support is already strong at ~94%.
Just keep in mind: unsupported browsers will skip `@container` rules entirely.
So be sure your base styles hold up without them.
