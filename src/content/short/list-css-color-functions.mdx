## CSS color functions are more powerful than ever.

Are you using them to their full potential?

Modern CSS now supports a rich set of color functions that go far beyond just rgb() and rgba().

Here’s a quick breakdown of what’s available:
1- hsl() / hsla()
Define colors using hue, saturation, and lightness. hsla() adds transparency.

2- lab() / oklab()
Perceptual color spaces that better match human vision. oklab() is optimized for digital use.

3- lch() / oklch()
Like lab()/oklab(), but in cylindrical form—great for adjusting brightness and intensity.

4- rgb() / rgba()
Classic red-green-blue color model. rgba() adds an alpha channel for opacity.

5- color()
Use advanced color spaces like display-p3 for more vibrant, high-fidelity colors.

6- color-mix()
Blend any two colors together, with control over mix ratio and color space.

7- color-contrast()
Automatically picks the most readable color from a list based on background.

8- hwb()
Defines color by hue, whiteness, and blackness—more intuitive for some adjustments.

9- device-cmyk()
Used for defining colors in print workflows using CMYK values.

10- light-dark()
Chooses a different color depending on light or dark mode.

These tools make it easier to create accessible, responsive, and future-proof designs.

Browser support for many of these is growing fast, especially in Chromium and Safari.
