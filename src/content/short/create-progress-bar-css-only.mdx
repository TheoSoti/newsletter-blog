## Use only CSS for progress bar

A progress bar is a perfect example of what's possible with modern CSS.
It leverages the power of animation-timeline: scroll();, which links the animation's progress directly to your scroll position.

As you scroll down the page, the progress bar fills up in perfect sync with your movement.
It's a subtle but effective way to enhance the user experience.

CSS keyframes also play a crucial role, defining the animation's behavior.
In this case, a simple width change from 0 to 100%.

The result?
A smooth, natural animation that feels intuitive and performant.

Plus, CSS animations are:

- Performant (hardware-accelerated)
- Accessible
- Great for reducing JavaScript dependencies

The only downside for now is the browser support.
The support for animation-timeline is currently around 73%.

I talk about CSS scroll animations in one of my blog posts.

```html
<header>
  <div class="progress"></div>
</header>
```

```css
.progress {
  background: #55ad9b;
  width: 0;
  height: 8px;
  animation: grow linear forwards;
  animation-timeline: scroll();
}

@keyframes grow {
  to {
    width: 100%;
  }
}
```
