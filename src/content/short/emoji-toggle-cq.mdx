## Make components responsive to their parent. Not the viewport.

In the demo, the icon changes based on the content's height.
All with CSS container queries.

Step 1 - declare a container.
Set `container-type: size;` on the wrapper (optionally `container-name: box;`).

Step 2 - define a default state.
Use `.content:after { content: "default"; }` or your base icon.

Step 3 - react to the container, not the page.
Write `@container (height > 60px) { .content:after { content: "state-1"; } }`.
Add another for a larger breakpoint, e.g. `(height > 240px)`.

As the content grows or shrinks, the pseudo-element swaps automatically.
No JavaScript. No viewport media queries.
Works inside grids, flex layouts, and nested components.

Support is solid in modern browsers with almost 93%.
Ship a sensible default so it still looks fine where `@container` isn’t supported.
