## You can combine scroll-driven animations with `@starting-style` in CSS.

The goal is simple.  
Fade elements in on page load.  
Then animate them based on scroll.

At first glance, it sounds easy.  
In practice, scroll timelines behave differently from classic animations.  
So you need a small setup.

### Register a custom property

Instead of animating opacity directly,  
animate a numeric value you control.

```css
@property --progress {
	syntax: '<number>';
	inherits: false;
	initial-value: 0;
}
```

This gives you a stable value to work with.

### Define the entry state

Use `@starting-style` to handle the initial fade-in.

```css
@starting-style {
	opacity: 0;
}
```

Now the browser knows the element’s starting point,  
even if it appears dynamically.

### Drive the animation with scroll

Animate the custom property using a scroll timeline.

```css
animation: progress linear both;
animation-timeline: view();
```

Then map it back to real styles.

```css
opacity: var(--progress);
```

That’s the pattern.

Smooth entry animation.  
Scroll-linked motion.  
No hacks.  
No JavaScript.

Just modern CSS doing modern UI work.

This kind of setup shows how far CSS has evolved.  
And how much interaction it can handle on its own.

Have you started experimenting with scroll-driven animations yet?!
