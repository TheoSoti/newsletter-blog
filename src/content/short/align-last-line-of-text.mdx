## Did you know you can align just the last line of a paragraph?

Most developers are familiar with text-align.
But thereâ€™s a lesser-known CSS property that gives you more control.

This lets you style the final line of text differently from the rest.
Hereâ€™s how it works:

```css
p {
  text-align: justify;
  text-align-last: end;
}
```

â€”> All lines are justified, except the last one, which aligns to the end.

The best part?
A solid 95.28% across modern browsers.
So yes, it's production-ready.
