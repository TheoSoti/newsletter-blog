## The native `<dialog>` element is more capable than you think.

It's not a new element, but it’s often overlooked in favor of custom modal components.

Yet it handles a lot out of the box:

- Built-in open/close API (.showModal() and method="dialog")
- Automatically traps focus for accessibility
- Keyboard support (like closing on Escape)
- Native backdrop with the ::backdrop pseudo-element
- Easily stylable with modern CSS
- Supports transitions with @starting-style and transition-behavior: allow-discrete

If you’ve been building modal systems from scratch, the native dialog might deserve a second look.

It’s simple, accessible, and works with the tools you already use.
Have you used `<dialog>` in production?

Here's the codepen: https://codepen.io/theosoti/pen/WbvJXvZ

The native `<dialog>` element simplifies focus management and modality with far less custom code. Keep close actions explicit and labels clear, then style `::backdrop` to reinforce context without reducing contrast.

The native `<dialog>` element reduces custom modal plumbing while preserving expected keyboard behavior. Clear close actions and accessible labels remain essential for usability.

Check autofill, mobile keyboards, and error feedback before shipping. These practical states reveal more than static demos and keep the form experience trustworthy.

To roll this out safely, start by applying `::backdrop` in a single UI surface where the benefit is obvious. After validation, expand gradually to matching components and avoid ad-hoc one-off overrides.
