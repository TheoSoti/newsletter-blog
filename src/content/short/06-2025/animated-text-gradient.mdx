## Animated text gradients with pure CSS?

Yes, it’s possible, and surprisingly smooth.

This technique uses `background-clip: text` to apply a gradient directly to the text.

It then animates the background to create a subtle shimmering effect.

A few things that make it work:

- Set the text color to `transparent` so only the background shows through.
- Use `background-size: 200% auto` to give the gradient space to move.
- Animate the `background-position` with keyframes to create motion.
- Repeat the first color at the end of your gradient (color1 → color2 → color1) to make the loop seamless.

No JavaScript needed. Just clever layering with modern CSS.

Support is solid across Chromium and WebKit browsers, with Firefox catching up.

Here's the codepen: https://codepen.io/theosoti/pen/ogNoRPp

Animated text gradients are most effective when motion stays restrained and contrast remains high. The static state should still read clearly, so users with reduced motion preferences keep full readability.

Animated text gradients should be treated as accent motion, not core content delivery. Keep fallback readability strong so users still understand the message without animation.

Use this as a readability tool, not only a visual effect. The best result is when style improves scanning speed without adding cognitive load.

A practical way to adopt `background-clip: text` is to scope it to one high-impact component first. After validation, expand gradually to matching components and avoid ad-hoc one-off overrides.
