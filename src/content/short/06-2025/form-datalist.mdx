## Build better forms with one HTML tag

Autocomplete. Suggestions. Flexibility.

The native `<datalist>` element can help improve form UX.

Here’s how it works:
You pair a standard `<input>` with a `<datalist>` using the `list` attribute.

Each `<option>` in the datalist appears as a suggestion as the user types, but they’re free to enter a completely custom value too.

And it’s not just for text. It works with `color`, `time` and `range`.

Why it’s worth using:

- Keeps forms lightweight and fast
- No extra libraries or JS required
- Fully accessible and keyboard-friendly
- Still allows user freedom, not just a strict dropdown

It’s a small detail that can make a big difference in form usability.
And the best part? It’s supported in all modern browsers with over 95% support.

Curious how often you reach for it!

Here's the codepen: https://codepen.io/theosoti/pen/azOKxoo

`datalist` is ideal for lightweight suggestions when users still need free text input. Treat suggestions as guidance, then validate submitted values normally because users can always type custom content.

`datalist` is best for lightweight suggestions where free typing remains important. Keep server-side validation in place, because users can always submit values outside suggestions.

For production forms, test keyboard order, disabled states, and validation messages with realistic labels. Native behavior should remain intact while visual polish improves.

For teams, `list` is easiest to maintain when it starts in one documented example before broader reuse. After validation, expand gradually to matching components and avoid ad-hoc one-off overrides.
