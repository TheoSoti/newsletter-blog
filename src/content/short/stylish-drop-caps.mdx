## Make your text pop with a single CSS trick.

Ever noticed those stylish drop caps in print media?
You can achieve the same effect in CSS easily.

The magic?
Just two lines of CSS:

```css
p:first-letter {
	initial-letter: 3 2;
}
```

- :first-letter targets the first character of a paragraph.
- initial-letter: 3 2; pushes text aside by two lines, creating a balanced look

This is perfect for giving articles, blogs, or long-form content a more refined and readable look.

Browser support is great for :first-letter with more than 97,5%.

For initial-letter it's good but not great with more than 91%.
