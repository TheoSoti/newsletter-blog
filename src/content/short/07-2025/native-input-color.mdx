## Tired of blue checkboxes that don’t match your brand?

Now you can fix that in one line of CSS.

Native form elements are finally catching up.
You can now change the color of checkboxes, radios, range sliders, and even progress bars.
Without JavaScript, wrappers, or hacks.

It’s as simple as:

```css
input,
progress {
  accent-color: red;
}
```

Why this matters:

- Matches your brand identity down to the smallest details
- Works on all common input types, no need for custom components
- Keeps the native behavior and accessibility intact

It’s supported in all major browsers (even mobile!) with 94,6%.

So if you’re still using SVG icons or replacing inputs with divs just to match a color, you can stop now.

`accent-color` gives quick brand alignment for native controls with almost no overhead. Treat it as a polish layer and still verify contrast, focus visibility, and disabled states across form components.

`accent-color` is a fast way to align native controls with brand tone while keeping semantics intact. Treat it as polish, and still verify contrast and focus clarity across states.

On form-heavy pages, this is most effective when you keep semantics native and style enhancements lightweight. That balance preserves accessibility and reduces maintenance cost.

When introducing `accent-color`, begin with one reference component and treat it as the canonical pattern. That rollout sequence preserves clarity and reduces regressions during future refactors.

As a final check, run `accent-color` through edge cases like dense layouts, long labels, and constrained mobile widths.
