## Say hello to native popovers in HTML…

Without a line of JavaScript!

The Popover API lets you create smooth popups using just HTML and CSS.
With the `popover` attribute, you can define elements that behave like tooltips, modals, or popups.
Combine it with the `popovertarget` and `popovertargetaction` attributes, and you've got full control over when and how the popover opens or closes.

Why use it?

- Clean, semantic HTML structure.
- No JavaScript needed
- Full accessibility baked in (no extra ARIA attributes required).
- Native browser support for interactions like open/close states.

Bonus: It is supported by 90% of the browsers so far.
So it is pretty safe to use!
