## Make your text wrap around images perfectly.

By default, text wraps around a boring rectangle.
But what if you could make it hug the actual shape of the image?

You can.
With just one CSS property:

`shape-outside: url(your-img.png);`

Add a `float` and a bit of margin with `shape-margin`,
and your layout feels instantly more refined.

No JavaScript. No layout hacks.
Just native CSS support and it's supported in over 95% of browsers.

Use it with transparent PNGs, SVGs, or even basic shapes like `circle()` or `polygon()`.
Ideal for editorial layouts, landing pages, or any design that needs more personality.
