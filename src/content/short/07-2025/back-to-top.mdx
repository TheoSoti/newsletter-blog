## Most “back to top” buttons use JavaScript.

But they really don’t have to.

The browser already knows how to scroll.
We just have to ask nicely.

All you need is:

- Give your page an `id="top"` (usually on the `<body>`).
- Add a link with `href="#top"` that scrolls back to the top.
- Use `position: fixed` to pin it in the corner.
- And `scroll-behavior: smooth` on the html for smooth transitions

No listeners.
No scroll events.
No extra code.

This is simpler, faster, and works everywhere.
Sometimes, native HTML and CSS are all you need.
