## Unlock the power of :nth-child() to target elements

But did you know you can use it to select an entire range of elements?

Instead of styling every third item or just the odd/even ones, you can define a precise segment.

This works by combining two `:nth-child()` selectors:

- `nth-child(n+4)`: Selects everything from the 3rd item onward.
- `nth-child(-n+7)`: Selects everything up to the 7th item.

Together, they create a flexible way to target only a specific range.

This trick is perfect for highlighting content or dynamically styling sections of a list.

Next time you need to style a group of elements, without adding extra classes, think about `:nth-child()`.
