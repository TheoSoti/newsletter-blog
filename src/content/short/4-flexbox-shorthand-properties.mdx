## Write cleaner Flexbox with these 4 shorthands.

Why write 3 linesâ€¦
When one will do the trick?

Flexbox has powerful shorthand properties that reduce clutter and make your CSS easier to read and maintain.

Here, Iâ€™ve condensed:
row-gap + column-gap â†’ gap: row col
flex-grow + flex-shrink + flex-basis â†’ flex: 1 1 0 (or just flex: 1)
align-content + justify-content â†’ place-content
flex-direction + flex-wrap â†’ flex-flow

These shorthands do exactly the same thing, just smarter and more scalable.

Pro tip: If youâ€™re building reusable components or utility classes, using shorthands is a great way to reduce CSS bloat.
