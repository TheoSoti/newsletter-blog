## Serve sharp backgrounds without extra code.

Let the browser pick the right asset.

`image-set()` is like `srcset`, but for CSS.

You give multiple sources. The browser chooses the best one for the screen.

Why use it:

- Retina screens get crisp images.
- Regular screens download smaller files.
- No JavaScript. No hacks.

It also works in other image-accepting properties like content, list-style-image, and border-image(but with less browser support).

Using `image-set()` in a background-image property has almost 96% browser support!

Practical tips:

- Add a plain fallback first for older browsers:
  `background-image: url("evee.png");` then the `image-set()`.
- Keep file names consistent (@1x, @2x) to simplify builds.
- Pair with background-size: cover/contain as needed.
- Test AVIF/WEBP plus JPEG/PNG as a safe fallback.
