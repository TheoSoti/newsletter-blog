For years, `vh` and `vw` were our go-to viewport units.

But mobile browsers’ dynamic toolbars made `100vh` unreliable, causing layout shifts.

Now, CSS gives us better control with new viewport units.

- `svh` / `svw` → Small Viewport (when toolbars are fully visible)
- `lvh` / `lvw` → Large Viewport (when toolbars are fully collapsed)
- `dvh` / `dvw` → Dynamic Viewport (adjusts in real time as the UI changes)

With these units, layouts can adapt fluidly without sudden jumps when the browser UI changes.

Need a full-height section?
Use `100dvh`, and it’ll always fit.

Want a consistent design even when toolbars disappear?
`lvh` has you covered.

The browser support is already solid at ~95%, so it’s pretty safe to use.
