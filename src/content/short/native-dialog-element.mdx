## The native `<dialog>` element is more capable than you think.

It's not a new element, but it’s often overlooked in favor of custom modal components.

Yet it handles a lot out of the box:

- Built-in open/close API (.showModal() and method="dialog")
- Automatically traps focus for accessibility
- Keyboard support (like closing on Escape)
- Native backdrop with the ::backdrop pseudo-element
- Easily stylable with modern CSS
- Supports transitions with @starting-style and transition-behavior: allow-discrete

If you’ve been building modal systems from scratch, the native dialog might deserve a second look.

It’s simple, accessible, and works with the tools you already use.
Have you used `<dialog>` in production?
