## Have you ever had trouble creating multiple line breaks?

Here is a cool CSS hack that cuts your text smartly.

Simply add few lines of CSS to implement multiline truncation with ellipsis.

Here’s what you need:

```css
display: -webkit-box;
-webkit-line-clamp: 3;
-webkit-box-orient: vertical;
overflow: hidden;
```

This CSS class will limit text content to three lines and hide the rest cut off content.

To break it down:

- display: -webkit-box = creates a flexible block container, similar to flexbox
- webkit-line-clamp = limits the number of visible lines.
- webkit-box-orient = ensures the content flows vertically.
- overflow: hidden = keeps things clean by hiding the rest of the text.

The result? Cut-off text that does not end colons.
It’s ideal for cards, previews or anywhere space is tight.

The best part?
It has more than 96% browser support!
