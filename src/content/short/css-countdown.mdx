## A CSS-only countdown.

No JavaScript needed.

This countdown from 10 to 0 is 100% CSS.

Hereâ€™s how it works:
1 - `@property` lets us define a custom CSS variable (--c) and can be animated.

2 - We animate --c from 10 to 0 using a `@keyframes` animation.

3 - Inside a `::after` pseudo-element, we use `counter-reset` to bind --c to a named CSS counter (count).

4 - Finally, we display the live-updating value using `content: counter(...)`.

No JavaScript. No `setInterval`. No updating the DOM.
Just clever use of CSS features that are finally starting to mature.

Browser support is pretty good with more than 92%
