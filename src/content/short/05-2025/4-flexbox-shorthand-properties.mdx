## Write cleaner Flexbox with these 4 shorthands.

Why write 3 lines…
When one will do the trick?

Flexbox has powerful shorthand properties that reduce clutter and make your CSS easier to read and maintain.

Here, I’ve condensed:
row-gap + column-gap → gap: row col
flex-grow + flex-shrink + flex-basis → flex: 1 1 0 (or just flex: 1)
align-content + justify-content → place-content
flex-direction + flex-wrap → flex-flow

These shorthands do exactly the same thing, just smarter and more scalable.

Pro tip: If you’re building reusable components or utility classes, using shorthands is a great way to reduce CSS bloat.
