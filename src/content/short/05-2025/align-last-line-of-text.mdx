## Did you know you can align just the last line of a paragraph?

Most developers are familiar with text-align.
But there’s a lesser-known CSS property that gives you more control.

This lets you style the final line of text differently from the rest.
Here’s how it works:

```css
p {
	text-align: justify;
	text-align-last: end;
}
```

—> All lines are justified, except the last one, which aligns to the end.

The best part?
A solid 95.28% across modern browsers.
So yes, it's production-ready.

`text-align-last` is most noticeable with longer justified paragraphs, so test with realistic content length before rolling it out globally. On very short text blocks, the visual effect can feel abrupt.

It is a great choice for editorial layouts, pull quotes, and card descriptions where you want a polished edge without extra markup. Keep it scoped to specific components instead of applying it site-wide.

`text-align-last` is subtle, but it adds polish to justified excerpts and editorial blocks. Apply it to selected content components rather than globally, so small UI labels are not affected unnecessarily.

`text-align-last` is subtle but effective in editorial UI and justified excerpts. Apply it selectively where line endings influence rhythm, rather than enabling it globally.

Use this as a readability tool, not only a visual effect. The best result is when style improves scanning speed without adding cognitive load.

When introducing `text-align-last`, begin with one reference component and treat it as the canonical pattern. That rollout sequence preserves clarity and reduces regressions during future refactors.
