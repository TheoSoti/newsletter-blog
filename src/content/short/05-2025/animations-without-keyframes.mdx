## Did you know you can animate without @keyframes?

The new `@starting-style` makes it possible.

It lets you define an element’s initial state.
CSS handles the transition from there.

- Simpler syntax
- Cleaner code
- Perfect for quick UI effects

But here’s the real magic:
You can now animate elements as they enter the DOM.
Think modals, tooltips, or anything that appears dynamically.

Before, CSS couldn’t animate them, it didn’t know their "before" state.
@starting-style changes that.

No more hacks. No more JS for basic transitions.
It’s supported in ~88% of browsers, so not production-ready yet.

Already tried it?
I’d love to hear how you’d use it.

A practical pattern is to combine it with transitions on `opacity` and `transform`, then define the entry state inside `@starting-style`. That gives you smooth mount animations without JS choreography.

Remember motion preferences too: wrap non-essential transitions in `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` so users who prefer reduced motion get a calmer experience.

`@starting-style` is especially helpful for entry transitions where elements mount dynamically. It keeps animation logic in CSS and removes common JS setup code for modals, popovers, and drawers.

`@starting-style` is especially useful for entry transitions on mounted elements like dialogs and popovers. It keeps animation behavior in CSS and reduces setup logic in JavaScript.

Motion should clarify state change, not distract from content. Keep timings short and ensure users can still complete actions quickly.
