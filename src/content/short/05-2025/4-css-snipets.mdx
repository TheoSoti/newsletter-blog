## CSS snippets you’ll actually reuse.

These aren’t flashy tricks.
They’re practical, time-saving patterns you’ll find yourself using again and again.

In this image, I’ve shared four essentials:

✅ A perfect circle using aspect-ratio

```css
.circle {
	aspect-ratio: 1;
	border-radius: 50%;
}
```

✅ A multiline text truncation with ellipsis (no JS required)

```css
.cut {
	display: -webkit-box;
	-webkit-line-clamp: 3;
	-webkit-box-orient: vertical;
	overflow: hidden;
}
```

✅ A quick way to center anything (yes, literally anything)

```css
.center {
	position: fixed;
	inset: 0;
	margin: auto;
}
```

✅ A responsive grid layout without media queries

```css
.grid {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(min(100%, 300px), 1fr));
}
```

They’re compact.
They work across browsers.
And they’re perfect to keep in your snippets library.
