## Did you know you can build a counter using only CSS?

No JavaScript. Just native CSS features.

With a few underrated properties, you can make live counters in pure CSS:

- `counter-reset`: Initializes or resets a counter.
  In this case, we start counting Pokémon from 0.

- `counter-increment`: Increases the counter whenever a condition is met.
  Here, every time an input is checked, it bumps the count.

- `content: counter()`: Displays the current value of the counter.
  It’s typically used inside `:before` or `:after` pseudo-elements.

In this example:

- Each selected Pokémon increases the count
- The total is displayed instantly
- Zero JS involved

With almost 96% browser support, it’s pretty safe to use!
