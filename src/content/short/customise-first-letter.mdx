## Want to give your paragraphs a touch of editorial flair?

CSS lets you style and position the first letter without any extra markup.

With the :first-letter pseudo-element, you can create drop caps and elegant intros like those seen in magazines.

The real magic comes from the initial-letter property.
It controls both the size and alignment of the first letter in just one line.

For example:

`initial-letter: 3 2;` means the letter spans 3 lines and aligns against 2 lines of baseline text.

You can then style it as you want.

Browser support is solid at over 95%.

Have you used :first-letter creatively before? Would love to see it!
