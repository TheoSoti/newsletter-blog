## Make your scrollbars match your UI. Do it with only two CSS properties.

`scrollbar-color `sets the colors.
First value is the thumb. Second is the track.
Example: `scrollbar-color: hashtag#8aaa8a hashtag#294b29;`

`scrollbar-width` controls size.
Use auto, thin, or none to hide it.
Example: `scrollbar-width: thin;`

Apply these on any scrollable container.
Or put them on `:root to style the page scrollbars.

It respects user settings like overlay scrollbars.
So on macOS they appear when scrolling and keep your colors.

Accessibility tip.
Pick a thumb color with strong contrast against the track.

For the browser support, it's not great for now.
~73% for the `scrollbar-color` property.
~83% for the `scrollbar-width` property.
But they graciously fallback to default style if not supported.
