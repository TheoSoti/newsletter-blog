## Want to give your UI a sleek, modern touch?

Try the CSS backdrop-filter property.

It lets you apply visual effects behind an element, like blur, brightness, or contrast.
It's what creates that soft, frosted-glass look you see in modern UIs.

Here’s how simple it is:

```css
.card {
  backdrop-filter: blur(5px);
}
```

That’s it.

One line of CSS, and your element blends beautifully into whatever is behind it.
You can combine multiple effects: blur(5px) brightness(1.2).

Bonus: It’s widely supported in modern browsers, with more than 96%
