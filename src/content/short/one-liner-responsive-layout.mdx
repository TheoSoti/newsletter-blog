## Responsive layouts in 1 CSS line ? Yes it’s possible! I’ll show you how ⬇️

Let’s analyse the magic behind grid-template-columns:

1. Repeat()

- repeat(x, value): generates multiple columns or rows with the same pattern.
- auto-fit: automatically adjusts the number of columns based on available space.

2. minmax(min(100%, 18.75rem), 1fr)

- min(100%, 18.75rem): ensures the column never exceeds 18.75rem but also doesn’t exceed the container’s width.
- minmax(..., 1fr): Sets a minimum size while allowing columns to grow and evenly fill available space.

Why this work so well?

- No media queries needed.
- Thanks to min(100%, 18.75rem), elements won’t exceed their container.
- Automatically adapts to different screen sizes and layouts.
- One line does all the work!

All these functions (repeat, minmax, min) have more than 96% browser support.

This one-liner is perfect for card layouts, galleries, and grids that need to be both structured and flexible.

Have you used this approach or a similar one before?
Let’s discuss in the comments!

```html
<div class="container">
	<div class="card"></div>
	<div class="card"></div>
	<div class="card"></div>
	<div class="card"></div>
</div>
```

```css
.container {
	display: grid;
	gap: 1rem;

	/* this line does it all */
	grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(min(100%, 18.75rem), 1fr));
}

.card {
	height: 12.5rem;
	background: #fff;
	border: 4px solid #000;
}
```
