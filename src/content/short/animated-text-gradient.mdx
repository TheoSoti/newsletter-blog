## Animated text gradients with pure CSS?

Yes, it’s possible, and surprisingly smooth.

This technique uses `background-clip: text` to apply a gradient directly to the text.

It then animates the background to create a subtle shimmering effect.

A few things that make it work:

- Set the text color to `transparent` so only the background shows through.
- Use `background-size: 200% auto` to give the gradient space to move.
- Animate the `background-position` with keyframes to create motion.
- Repeat the first color at the end of your gradient (color1 → color2 → color1) to make the loop seamless.

No JavaScript needed. Just clever layering with modern CSS.

Support is solid across Chromium and WebKit browsers, with Firefox catching up.
