## Writing less CSS has never been easier.

Modern properties are doing some serious heavy lifting.

Here is a list of 5 CSS improvements

Instead of:

```css
div {
	transform: scale(2);
}
```

Just write:

```css
div {
	scale: 2;
}
```

Instead of:

```css
div {
	top: 0;
	right: 0;
	bottom: 0;
	left: 0;
}
```

Just write:

```css
div {
	inset: 0;
}
```

And there's more:

- `:is()` simplifies selectors.
- `min()` or `max()` combines constraints.
- `margin-inline` or `margin-block` makes layouts more flexible.

All of these tweaks add up to cleaner CSS.
