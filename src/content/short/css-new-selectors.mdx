## Tired of writing long, tedious CSS selectors?

Thankfully, `:is()` and `:where()` make things much cleaner.

Both of them let you group selectors, reducing redundancy and improving readability.

There is one key difference between the 2: specificity.

- `:is()` inherits the highest specificity from the elements inside it. If one of its child selectors has high specificity, the whole rule does too.
- `:where()` always has zero specificity. It won’t override other styles unless there’s no conflicting rule.

The best part ?
They are widely supported in all modern browsers.
With over 95% support!

These selectors clean up your CSS, make maintenance easier, and help avoid specificity battles.
