## Text with a moving background?

No JavaScript needed.

This effect is pure CSS, and it's clean, fast, and surprisingly easy to pull off.

We use:

- background-image 👉 display the image
- background-clip: text 👉 attach the image to the text
- color: transparent 👉 make the text invisible (to see the image behind it)
- A simple `@keyframes` animation

That’s it.

Just a few lines of code and your typography comes alive.

- No libraries.
- No DOM hacks.
- No bloat.

Perfect for hero sections, portfolios, landing pages, or even just showing off what CSS can do.

It’s part of a growing mindset:

Use less JS. Push CSS further.

There’s a lot you can build without JavaScript, and it’s more fun than you think.
