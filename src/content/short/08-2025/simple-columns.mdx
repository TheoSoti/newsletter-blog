## Did you know you can create a column layout without grid or flex?

It only takes 2 lines of CSS and can be useful!

One key advantage is the ability to easily add separators between columns.

So how to implement it?

Apply the `columns` property to your container. This property accepts up to two values:

- The minimum width of a column (not mandatory)
- The number of desired columns (mandatory)

And just with that it works!

But you can go further by:

- Using the `gap` property to create spacing between columns.
- Adding separator with the “column-rule” property (it works just like `border`).
- Make an element span across all columns with the `column-span` property.

Don’t hesitate to use it in your next project!
