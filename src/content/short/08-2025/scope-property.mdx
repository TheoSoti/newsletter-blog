## Ever felt like your CSS is leaking all over the place?

You’re not alone, it’s a familiar pain.

But now, we have `@scope`.
It lets you define where your styles begin, and where they end.

Think of it like local styles, without the need for CSS-in-JS, BEM, or tons of utility classes.

```css
@scope (.container) to (.post) {
  p {
    color: blue;
  }
}
```

That `p` won’t be styled if it’s inside `.post`. Simple and clean.

Here’s why this matters:

- Styles don’t leak outside components
- Fewer class names, cleaner HTML
- Control over specificity and proximity
- Donut scopes (yes, really)

Even better, you can nest scopes.
You can keep styles modular without naming gymnastics.

This is real encapsulation, built into CSS itself.
If you’ve ever wished CSS had better boundaries, this is it.

The only downside is its browser support with only 86.56%.
