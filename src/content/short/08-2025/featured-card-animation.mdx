## Ever wondered how to do a light sweep animation?

It’s pretty easy when you understand the logic.
I’ll show you here how to do it for a featured card.

But this can be declined for every components you need.
And no JavaScript needed.
Let's break it down into three key parts:

1- The card itself

Start with a container. Add a child div for the animation.
Style it however you like, but don’t forget `position: relative`. This anchors everything in place.

2- The animation Effect

The rotating light effect uses CSS animations combined with a conic gradient.
The animation layer fills the card with `position: absolute` and `inset: 0`.
Use a custom CSS property to control the rotation value.

It makes the animation flexible and easy to tweak.

Next, define a keyframe to rotate the light beam 360 degrees.
This will create that smooth sweep effect.

3- Superposing the :after element

To make the card complete, we overlay an :after pseudo-element on the effect.
It should sit on top with a slight inset (e.g., 4px) to create a border.
This frames the animation and gives it a polished look.

This approach is simple yet powerful.

With just CSS, you can create a dynamic, visually engaging elements that grabs attention.
