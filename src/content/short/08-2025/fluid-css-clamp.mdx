## Media queries aren't the only solution for responsive design.

With clamp(), you can reduce their use significantly!

But wait, what is clamp()?

Clamp is a native css function that allow you to specify:

- a minimum value
- a preferred value (usually with % or viewport units)
- a maximum value

Its syntax looks like this: clamp(5em, 30%, 10em)

In short, it makes elements scale smoothly without relying on media queries.

Clamp is often used for padding, margins, width and font-size.

But it can handle anything with numerical values, such as:

aspect-ratio, gap, positioning, …

With ~95.2% browser support, it’s safe to use.
