## Tired of battling CSS specificity wars?

Meet CSS Layers.

A native solution to organise and control your stylesheets more effectively.

Why use them?

- Manage specificity and source order with ease.
- Avoid unintended overrides from third-party styles or components.
- Enhance maintainability in large codebases.

How to implement:
This part shows how to set up and organize your styles using CSS Layers:

```css
@layer secondary, main;
```

This line declares the order of your layers. It's like a priority list:

- `secondary` layer loads first (lowest priority)
- `main` comes after (highest priority)

Then, you define your actual styles inside those layers:

```css
@layer main {
  /* your style */
}
@layer secondary {
  /* your style */
}
```

Each layer is scoped, and the order you define them in the initial @layer line determines their priority.

Check out the visual:

- Left = classic CSS behavior → body h1 wins with higher specificity
- Right = layered CSS → h1 in the main layer wins, even with lower specificity

95%+ browser support makes this a no-brainer to start using now.
