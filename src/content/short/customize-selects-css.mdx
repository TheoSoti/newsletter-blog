## Say goodbye to ugly `<select>`.

CSS now gives you full control.

For years, `<select>` elements have been frustrating to style.
Often needing JavaScript or UI libraries.
Now, modern browsers bring full customization to native dropdowns.

What‚Äôs New?
Chrome introduces new CSS properties for better `<select>` styling.
No more browser inconsistencies!

- Total Style Control:
  Customize backgrounds, borders, and padding without hacks.

- Custom Dropdowns:
  Control width, height, and animations.
  No more default system styles.

- Multi-Column & Scrollable Options:
  Create advanced layouts, scrolling areas, and better positioning.

Why It Matters?

- Dropdowns match your design system without breaking accessibility.
- Native UI is lighter and quicker.
- No need for extra libraries nor JavaScript.

Rolling out in Chrome 135+, with other browsers likely to follow.
Start experimenting today!

This will finally end painful `<select>` styling üî•
