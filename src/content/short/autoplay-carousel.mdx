## Still using JavaScript for an autoplay carousel?

You don’t need to anymore.

A one-directional, looping logo strip can now be built entirely with CSS.
No `setInterval`. No libraries. No layout shifts.

Here’s how it works:
You define a few CSS custom properties:

- `--width` and `--height` to size each item
- `--quantity` to set how many elements are in the loop
- `--duration` for how long one full cycle takes

Each item gets a `--position`, so we can stagger its animation using `animation-delay`.

This formula spaces each item evenly:

```css
calc((var(--duration)/var(--quantity)) * (var(--position) - 1) - var(--duration))
```

It ensures that the track starts full, no empty gaps at load.

The animation itself is simple:
From `left: 100%` to `left: -width`, sliding items across the track.

We use `position: absolute` so every item animates independently,
and `overflow: hidden` on the container to act as a viewport.

For a smooth entrance and exit, we apply a `mask-image` gradient.

This fades logos in/out without extra DOM or performance hits.

Accessibility? Covered.
Each logo gets `tabindex="0"` so keyboard users can focus them,
and the entire animation pauses on hover or focus using `:has(:focus)` and `animation-play-state: paused`.
No JavaScript.
Just CSS, doing what used to take 100KB+ of JS.
