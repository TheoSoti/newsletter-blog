## Smarter sizing with just one CSS function.

Let your content define the layout... dynamically.
You can now use calc-size() to compute size values based on both layout constraints and live attributes.
Why is that a big deal?

Because it makes things like this rating system possible with:

- No JS
- No inline styles
- No custom properties

Just pure CSS, reacting to attributes like data-rating.
The calc-size() function is a new addition to CSS.

It allows you to perform calculations using intrinsic size values like auto, min-content, max-content, or fit-content.

These values aren’t supported in regular calc(), which makes calc-size() a powerful new tool.
You can also use this function to animate an element’s height to auto!

It’s powerful, it’s expressive, and it unlocks a new level of flexibility for dynamic UI design.
