## Subgrid is your new best friend.

Instead of each item defining its own layout, it inherits the parent’s grid structure.

That means:

- No more inconsistent heights.
- No more manually tweaking spacing.
- Everything stays perfectly aligned.

To make it work, it’s simple:

- Set `display: grid` on the child element.
- Use `grid-template-rows: subgrid` or `grid-template-columns: subgrid`.
- Use `grid-row: span 3;` (or equivalent) to stretch items across multiple tracks within the parent grid.
- The child now follows the parent’s grid.

In the pricing card example, all sections stay aligned across all cards, no extra hacks needed.

Subgrid is great in component-based layouts:

- Blog listings where titles, excerpts, and metadata align.
- Feature grids with perfectly balanced headings and descriptions.
- Dashboards where stats and labels need precise positioning.
- Forms with consistent input and label alignment.

Subgrid is reliable for most modern browsers with 91.51% support.

Some older browsers might need fallbacks, so use it as progressive enhancement where needed.

Here is the code:

```html
<section class="container">
	<div class="card">
		<h2>First plan - super long title</h2>
		<p>Content</p>
		<button>Super Cheap</button>
	</div>
	<div class="card">
		<h2>Best plan</h2>
		<p>Content</p>
		<button>Great Value</button>
	</div>
	...
</section>
```

```css
.container {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr 1fr;
	gap: 1rem;
}

.card {
	display: grid;
	grid-template-rows: subgrid;
	grid-row: span 3;
}
```
