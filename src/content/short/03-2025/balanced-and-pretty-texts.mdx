## No more awkward text wrapping. Let CSS handle it beautifully.

CSS gives us two new ways to make typography more visually pleasing:

- text-wrap: balance;
- text-wrap: pretty;

## What’s the difference?

1 - text-wrap: balance;
It makes sure each line has a similar length, preventing one-word last lines or uneven spacing.
Perfect for headlines or short text blocks.

2 - text-wrap: pretty;
It optimizes letter and word spacing to create a more natural and visually appealing text flow.
Great for longer paragraphs where readability is key.

## Why should you care?

- No more weird line breaks.
- More control over how text is displayed.
- Better readability without extra HTML or JS.

Browser support is already at ~88%.
It’s not perfect, but since unsupported browsers just ignore it, there’s no downside.

Simple CSS tricks make a huge difference.

```css
.balanced {
  text-wrap: balance;
}

.pretty {
  text-wrap: pretty;
}
```
