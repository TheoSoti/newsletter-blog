## Did you know CSS has a hidden gem called display: contents?

It's a powerful tool that helps simplify layouts without adding extra DOM elements.
It removes an element from the layout while keeping its children intact.

## Why is this so powerful?

- It lets you restructure layouts without adding extra wrappers.
- It works seamlessly with Flexbox and Grid, making designs more flexible.
- It pairs perfectly with order to rearrange content without duplication.

On desktop, blocks 2 and 3 sit next to block 1 inside a container.
On mobile, block 2 moves above block 1, and block 3 drops below it.

Normally, this would require workarounds: extra markup, hacks, or even duplicated content.

With display: contents, it's just one line of CSS.

Browser support is already at 97%!
But be aware, this property has some accessibility issues, especially with screen readers.

```html
<section>
  <div class="first"></div>

  <div class="container">
    <div class="second"></div>
    <div class="third"></div>
  </div>
</section>
```

```css
section {
  grid-template-columns: 1fr;
}
.container {
  display: contents;
}
.first {
  order: 2;
}
.second {
  order: 1;
}
.third {
  order: 3;
}
```

`display: contents` can simplify wrapper-heavy markup in layout contexts, but semantics still matter. Verify accessibility tree behavior for interactive and labeled content before broad adoption.

Selector-driven improvements scale best when specificity remains controlled. Keep targeting rules readable so future edits do not become cascade puzzles.

To roll this out safely, start by applying `display: contents` in a single UI surface where the benefit is obvious. That rollout sequence preserves clarity and reduces regressions during future refactors.

Use `display: contents` selectively on structural wrappers, and keep semantic elements intact when labels or landmarks are required.
