## You probably know `text-decoration: underline;`.

But do you know what else it can do?

Most developers stop at text-decoration: underline;
But CSS has a whole toolbox of styling options hiding in plain sight.

Here are some underrated text-decoration properties you can be using:

- text-decoration-thickness: 5px;
  Control the thickness of the line

- text-decoration-color: deeppink;
  Change the lineâ€™s color (it can be animated independently of the text's color)

- text-decoration-style: solid | dashed | wavy;
  Customize the lineâ€™s appearance

- text-decoration-skip-ink: auto | none;
  Decide whether the line should skip descenders (like g/j/y)

- text-decoration-line: underline | overline | line-through;
  Choose the position(s), or combine them

- text-underline-offset: 1em;
  Offset the line for better spacing and clarity

Perfect for giving your typography more control and visual polish.

Bonus: itâ€™s supported in all browsers.
