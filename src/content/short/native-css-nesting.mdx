## Stop using CSS preprocessor!

CSS nesting is now natively supported.

If you were using a preprocessor only for this feature,

It might be time to go back to plain CSS.

(Otherwise you can stick with it).

1/ No build tools required

- It makes the development setup easier.
- It also reduces the project’s build time.

2/ Reduced file size

- Sass expands rules during compilation, increasing the final CSS size.
- CSS nesting doesn't expand rules, resulting in smaller CSS.

Browser support is already strong at 91.3%.

But keep in mind that unsupported browsers will fail to parse nested rules.

If you need full compatibility, consider using a build step until support is universal.

If nesting was the only thing keeping you tied to a preprocessor… maybe it’s time to go vanilla.
