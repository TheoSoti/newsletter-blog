## You can create gradient borders in pure CSS.

No extra elements. No pseudo-elements.
Here’s how it works:

Set a thick transparent border.

Then layer two backgrounds:

- A solid fill using `padding-box`
- A gradient using `border-box`

The transparent border acts as space for the gradient to show through.

It works seamlessly with `border-radius`.
And because it's just one element, it keeps your HTML clean.

Now let’s go a step further: animation.

With the `@property` rule, you can register custom values, like an angle.

That allows CSS to transition between them smoothly.

Define something like `--angle` for your gradient direction.

Update it on hover or with a keyframe.

CSS will animate the change automatically, no JavaScript needed.

This opens up subtle, lightweight effects for buttons, cards, and more.

And since it's based on native CSS features, it's well-supported and performant.
