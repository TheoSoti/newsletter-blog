## Unlock powerful animations with `@property` !

Defining all your CSS variables in :root?

It works, but it has some limitations:

- You can't tell if a variable is valid or not.
- Impossible to animate certain values.
- Debugging is messy.
- Browsers give you zero feedback.

That's where `@property` comes in.

It doesn’t replace CSS variables, it upgrades them.

With `@property`, you get automatic validation, better debugging, and the ability to animate certain types of variables that were never animatable before.

If a value is invalid, it falls back cleanly instead of silently breaking your design.

Plus, you get warnings when something’s wrong, no more guessing.

If you want more powerful variables in your CSS, it’s time to make `@property` part of your toolbox.
