## Place elements relative to their siblings.

With one CSS function.

Meet sibling-index().

It gives each element a number.
Based on its position among siblings.

That number can drive layout.
No extra classes.
No :nth-child() chains.
No JavaScript.

Here’s the trick I used to place dots in a circle.

Each dot computes its own angle.

```css
.dot {
	--angle: calc(sibling-index() * 9deg);
	--radius: 240px;

	position: absolute;
	width: 25px;
	height: 25px;
	transform: translate(-50%, -50%);

	top: calc(50% + sin(var(--angle)) * var(--radius));
	left: calc(50% + cos(var(--angle)) * var(--radius));
}
```

Here’s what happens.

sibling-index() returns the position of the dot.
You multiply it by 9deg.
That spreads 40 dots across a full circle.

Then sin() and cos() convert the angle into coordinates.
top uses sin().
left uses cos().

The circle is centered with 50%.
The dot is centered with translate(-50%, -50%).

Simple math.
Pure CSS.
Very little markup.

Browser support is still limited.
About 69.3% today.
And there is no Firefox support yet.

But the idea is powerful.
CSS is getting real logic now.

What would you build with sibling-index()?

`sibling-index()` is excellent for staggered offsets and sequence-based styling without extra classes. Combined with `calc()`, it keeps patterns adaptive when list order changes or items are inserted dynamically.

`sibling-index()` is great for sequence-aware styling without adding helper classes. It becomes especially useful for staggered layouts where item order can change and manual nth rules become fragile.

A quick edge-case audit with inserted elements helps confirm that selector logic stays predictable over time.

To roll this out safely, start by applying `sibling-index()` in a single UI surface where the benefit is obvious. After validation, expand gradually to matching components and avoid ad-hoc one-off overrides.
