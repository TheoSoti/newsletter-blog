## Have you ever wanted to create an inverted hover effect?

I'll show you how with just 2 extra lines of CSS!

No hacks.
No JavaScript.
Just the power of :has().

For years, CSS couldn't style parent elements based on their children.
But now, :has() changes the game.

Hover over an element, and :has() lets the parent react, applying styles to everything else.

- No extra HTML.
- No complex workarounds.
- Just a clean, native way to control interactions.

The result?
A smooth hover effect that shifts focus exactly where you want it.
And this is just one use case.

With :has() you can also:

- Build dark mode toggles.
- Improve form validation styles.
- Create advanced parent-child interactions.
- Enhance focus and selection effects.
- And more...

With over 93% browser support, it’s pretty safe to use.

```html
<ul class="cardlist">
  <li class="card">...</li>
  <li class="card">...</li>
  <li class="card">...</li>
  <li class="card">...</li>
</ul>
```

```css
.cardlist:has(.card:hover) .card:not(:hover) {
  filter: blur(4px);
}
```
