## Did you know you can animate without @keyframes?

The new `@starting-style` makes it possible.

It lets you define an element’s initial state.
CSS handles the transition from there.

- Simpler syntax
- Cleaner code
- Perfect for quick UI effects

But here’s the real magic:
You can now animate elements as they enter the DOM.
Think modals, tooltips, or anything that appears dynamically.

Before, CSS couldn’t animate them, it didn’t know their "before" state.
@starting-style changes that.

No more hacks. No more JS for basic transitions.
It’s supported in ~88% of browsers, so not production-ready yet.

Already tried it?
I’d love to hear how you’d use it.
