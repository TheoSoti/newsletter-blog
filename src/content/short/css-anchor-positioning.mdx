## Positioning UI elements just got easier.

Meet CSS Anchor Positioning!

Positioning elements dynamically has always been a hassle.
Absolute positioning, JavaScript calculations, and unexpected layout shifts...

But the new Anchor Positioning makes everything better!

## How does it work?

- Define an element as an anchor using `anchor-name`
- Then position another element relative to it with `anchor()`.

No more guesswork, just native, flexible, and precise positioning.

## Some real-world use cases:

- Tooltips that stay perfectly attached to their trigger.
- Dropdown menus that align dynamically with their button.
- Modals or popovers that position relative to an element instead of the whole viewport.
- Notifications that stick near the related content.

What about browser support?
Not great for now, with only a bit more than 71%.
It doesn’t work on firefox and safari.

With features like this, CSS is proving once again that it's becoming more powerful than ever!

```html
<div class="container">
  <button class="anchor-button">Anchor</button>
  <div class="notice">I'm a great notice!</div>
</div>
```

```css
.anchor-button {
  anchor-name: --anchor-el;
}

.notice {
  position-anchor: --anchor-el;
  position: absolute;
  bottom: anchor(top);
  justify-self: anchor-center;
  margin: 0.5rem 0;
}
```
