## Crop images with precision, directly in CSS.

Forget `clip-path` and forget editing assets.

With `object-view-box`, you can zoom and crop right from your stylesheet.
It's like `viewBox` in SVG, but for any element using `object-fit`.

```css
img {
  object-fit: cover;
  object-view-box: inset(20% 0 0 0);
}
```

The syntax is familiar: use `inset()` or even `rect()` to define your cropping zone.
This works alongside `object-fit` to give you complete control over what portion of the image is displayed.

Need to zoom on a specific part of an image?
Want to highlight just a region inside a video or iframe?

No JavaScript. No image editing. No container tricks.
Just pure CSS.

Browser support is still experimental (~76%), so don’t use it in production yet.
But it’s available behind flags or in dev builds for testing.

This property is the kind of thing you’ll soon wonder how you ever built layouts without.
