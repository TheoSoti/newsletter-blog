## Before/after slider with just 1 line of JavaScript?

Yes, it’s possible!

Most comparison sliders rely on extra JavaScript,
But CSS can do most of the work for us.

## How does it work?

- Both sections and the slider are placed in the same grid cell, ensuring perfect overlap.
- A mask on each section controls its visibility. As the slider moves, one section gradually disappears while the other is revealed.
- The range input updates the mask position dynamically, creating a seamless effect.

## Why use this approach?

- No need for complex JavaScript logic.
- CSS handles most of the work efficiently.
- A simple structure with clear separation of concerns.
- Over 95% browser support!

This technique is perfect for image comparisons, UI demos, and interactive before/after effects.

```html
<div class="compare">
	<section class="before">I'm the left section</section>
	<section class="after">I'm the right section</section>
	<input type="range" id="range" step="0.1" />
</div>
```

```css
.compare {
	display: grid;

	> * {
		grid-area: 1 / 1;
	}
}

section {
	display: grid;
	align-items: center;
	justify-content: center;
}

.before {
	background-color: #fff8f0;
	mask: linear-gradient(to right, #000 0, var(--pos, 50%), transparent 0);
}

.after {
	background-color: #122b1f;
	mask: linear-gradient(to right, transparent 0, var(--pos, 50%), #000 0);
	color: #fff8f0;
}
```

```js
range.oninput = () => document.body.style.setProperty('--pos', range.value + '%');
```
