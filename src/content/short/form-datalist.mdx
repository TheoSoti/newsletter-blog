## Build better forms with one HTML tag

Autocomplete. Suggestions. Flexibility.

The native `<datalist>` element can help improve form UX.

Here’s how it works:
You pair a standard `<input>` with a `<datalist>` using the `list` attribute.

Each `<option>` in the datalist appears as a suggestion as the user types, but they’re free to enter a completely custom value too.

And it’s not just for text. It works with `color`, `time` and `range`.

Why it’s worth using:

- Keeps forms lightweight and fast
- No extra libraries or JS required
- Fully accessible and keyboard-friendly
- Still allows user freedom, not just a strict dropdown

It’s a small detail that can make a big difference in form usability.
And the best part? It’s supported in all modern browsers with over 95% support.

Curious how often you reach for it!
